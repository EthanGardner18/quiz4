# WAP to demonstrate ABC. Create a base class and inside of this base class there
# should be two abstract methods (use @bastractmethod decorator). This base class
# should be inherited by two other classes which will implement the methods inside of
# the base class. Come up with your own classes. Please do not create a class called
# vehicle and inherit it into motorbike and car.
# [Name of the file should be abc_class.py](1point)
